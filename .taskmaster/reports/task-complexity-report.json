			"reasoning": "This is a container task that serves as a collection point for future enhancements. It's already well-expanded with 15 detailed subtasks covering various aspects like CLI tools, internationalization, documentation, MFA, performance optimization, and testing. No further expansion needed as it effectively organizes future work."

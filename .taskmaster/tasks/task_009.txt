# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add Internationalization and Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement i18n support with externalized strings and ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
# Details:
Internationalization:
- Externalize all user-facing strings to JSON files
- Default English locale with override mechanism
- Support for custom locale JSON files
- Integration with Nuxt i18n module
- Pluralization support for dynamic content

Accessibility:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Focus management for modals and dropdowns
- Color contrast validation
- Alternative text for all images and icons
- Semantic HTML structure

# Test Strategy:
Accessibility audit with axe-core, keyboard navigation tests, screen reader tests with NVDA/JAWS, color contrast validation, i18n tests with multiple locales.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Nuxt i18n module and base locale structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the Nuxt i18n module and create the base directory structure for locale files with English as the default language
### Details:
Install the Nuxt i18n module using npm/yarn. Configure the module in nuxt.config.js with English as the default locale. Create a locales directory with subdirectories for each supported language (starting with 'en'). Set up the base JSON structure for string externalization with appropriate namespacing for different sections of the application.

## 2. Externalize all user-facing strings to locale files [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Extract all hardcoded strings from components and views into the locale JSON files with support for pluralization
### Details:
Systematically go through all components and views to identify user-facing strings. Replace hardcoded strings with i18n translation keys. Implement pluralization for dynamic content using the appropriate i18n syntax. Create a consistent naming convention for translation keys based on component/page hierarchy. Document the translation process for future development.

## 3. Implement semantic HTML and ARIA attributes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance HTML structure with semantic elements and add appropriate ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility
### Details:
Audit all components and replace non-semantic elements (like excessive divs) with appropriate semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc.). Add ARIA roles, states, and properties where HTML semantics are insufficient. Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) throughout the application. Add aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby attributes to improve context for screen readers.

## 4. Implement keyboard navigation and focus management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and implement proper focus management for modals and dynamic content
### Details:
Verify that all interactive elements can be accessed and activated using keyboard-only navigation. Implement custom keyboard shortcuts where appropriate, with documentation. Create a focus trap for modal dialogs to prevent focus from leaving the modal when open. Ensure that focus returns to the triggering element when a modal is closed. Implement skip links for main content navigation. Add visible focus indicators that meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements.

## 5. Implement color contrast and visual accessibility features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios and add alternative text for all visual elements
### Details:
Audit all color combinations in the UI to ensure they meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Add alt text to all images and meaningful icons. Ensure that information is not conveyed by color alone by adding additional visual cues or text. Make sure all form elements have visible labels. Implement a mechanism to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

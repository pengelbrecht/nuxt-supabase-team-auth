- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Integration examples with popular Nuxt modules
- Performance optimization tips

# Test Strategy:
Documentation accuracy tests, demo app functionality tests, integration guide validation, performance benchmarks against â‰¤150ms P95 latency requirement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base Demo Application Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational Nuxt 3 application structure with routing, layouts, and basic pages for the demo application.
### Details:
Initialize a new Nuxt 3 project with TypeScript support. Create the basic folder structure including layouts, pages, and components directories. Set up the main navigation and implement skeleton pages for sign-up, dashboard, team management, profile, and admin panel. Configure basic styling with a CSS framework that will allow for later integration examples with different UI frameworks.

## 2. Implement Core Authentication Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Integrate all team-auth features into the demo application, focusing on authentication flows and team management functionality.
### Details:
Implement the useTeamAuth composable throughout the application. Create working examples of user registration, login, team creation, team joining, role management, and user profile management. Implement proper state management for authentication status. Demonstrate different authentication strategies (JWT, session-based, etc.) and show how to handle authentication persistence across page reloads.

## 3. Create UI Framework Integration Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Develop multiple versions of key components using different UI frameworks to demonstrate integration flexibility.
### Details:
Create parallel implementations of authentication components (login forms, team management interfaces, etc.) using at least three popular UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind, Vuetify, Nuxt UI, Bootstrap). Organize these examples in a way that developers can easily switch between implementations to see how team-auth integrates with their preferred UI framework. Include code snippets and explanations for each integration approach.

## 4. Implement Performance Optimization and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Add comprehensive error handling and performance optimization examples throughout the demo application.
### Details:
Implement loading states, error boundaries, and user feedback mechanisms for all authentication operations. Add examples of lazy loading components and routes. Demonstrate proper error handling for network issues, validation errors, and server errors. Create examples of performance optimization techniques such as caching authentication state, minimizing re-renders, and optimizing API calls. Include monitoring and debugging tools integration examples.

## 5. Create Comprehensive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Develop complete documentation covering all aspects of the team-auth module and demo application.
### Details:
Create detailed documentation including: installation and setup guide with step-by-step instructions; complete API reference for the useTeamAuth composable with all methods, properties, and events; component documentation detailing props, slots, and events; migration guide and versioning policy; security best practices and recommendations; troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions; integration examples with popular Nuxt modules; and performance optimization tips. Include code snippets, diagrams, and examples throughout the documentation. Organize documentation in a logical structure with clear navigation.

# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Security Hardening and Audit Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive security measures, audit logging, and vulnerability prevention mechanisms
# Details:
Security Hardening:
- JWT signature validation with custom claims verification
- Rate limiting for sensitive operations (invites, role changes)
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention in custom queries
- Secure token generation and hashing
- Session fixation prevention
- Privilege escalation detection and prevention

Audit Logging:
- Immutable audit trail for all team operations
- 1-year retention policy for impersonation sessions
- Comprehensive logging for role changes, invitations, deletions
- Security event logging (failed auth, suspicious activity)
- Log integrity verification
- GDPR-compliant data handling

# Test Strategy:
Security penetration testing, audit log integrity tests, privilege escalation prevention tests, rate limiting validation, input sanitization tests, session security tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement JWT Validation and Token Security [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up JWT signature validation with custom claims verification and implement secure token generation and hashing mechanisms
### Details:
Create a JWT validation middleware that verifies signatures using a secure algorithm (RS256 recommended). Implement custom claims verification to check user roles, permissions, and token expiration. Set up secure token generation for authentication flows with proper entropy sources. Implement password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2 with appropriate work factors. Add session fixation prevention by regenerating session IDs after authentication.

## 2. Implement Rate Limiting and CSRF Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Add rate limiting for sensitive operations and implement CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
### Details:
Implement rate limiting middleware using a token bucket or sliding window algorithm. Configure stricter limits for authentication endpoints, role changes, and team invitations. Store rate limit data in Redis for distributed environments. Add CSRF protection using double-submit cookie pattern or synchronizer token pattern. Generate CSRF tokens for forms and validate them on submission. Include proper CSRF headers for AJAX requests.

## 3. Implement Input Validation and SQL Injection Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add comprehensive input validation, sanitization, and SQL injection prevention mechanisms
### Details:
Create validation middleware using a schema validation library (Joi, Yup, or Zod). Implement input sanitization for user-provided content to prevent XSS. Use parameterized queries or an ORM with proper escaping for all database operations. Review and secure any custom SQL queries. Implement content security policy headers. Add validation for file uploads including type checking and size limits.

## 4. Implement Audit Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive audit logging system for security events and sensitive operations
### Details:
Design and implement an immutable audit log structure with tamper-evident features (hash chaining or digital signatures). Create logging middleware to capture authentication events, role changes, team operations, and security incidents. Implement log rotation with 1-year retention for impersonation sessions. Add metadata to logs including user IDs, IP addresses, and timestamps. Ensure GDPR compliance by avoiding logging of sensitive personal data. Implement log integrity verification mechanism.

## 5. Implement Privilege Escalation Detection and Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.4
### Description: Add mechanisms to detect and prevent privilege escalation attempts and suspicious activities
### Details:
Implement role-based access control checks at both API and service layers. Create permission verification middleware for all sensitive operations. Add detection for unusual behavior patterns (multiple failed attempts, accessing unauthorized resources). Implement alerts for suspicious activities. Create an authorization matrix defining allowed operations per role. Add context-aware authorization checks that consider resource ownership and team membership.

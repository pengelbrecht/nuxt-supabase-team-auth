# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create Comprehensive Test Suite and CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Build complete testing infrastructure with unit, integration, and E2E tests achieving ≥90% coverage
# Details:
Test Suite:
- Unit tests for all composables, components, and utilities (Jest/Vitest)
- Integration tests for Supabase Edge Functions and database operations
- E2E tests for complete user flows (Cypress/Playwright)
- Component testing with Vue Test Utils
- API testing for all endpoints
- Security testing for auth flows and permissions
- Performance testing for latency requirements
- Accessibility testing with automated tools

CI/CD Pipeline:
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Code coverage reporting with ≥90% target
- Security scanning with dependency checks
- Lighthouse performance and accessibility audits (≥90 a11y score)
- Automated deployment to staging environment
- Release automation with semantic versioning
- Database migration testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

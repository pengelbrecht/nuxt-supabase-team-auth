# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add performance optimizations, caching strategies, and monitoring to meet the â‰¤150ms P95 latency requirement
# Details:
Performance Optimization:
- Client-side caching for team data and user profiles
- Optimistic updates for UI responsiveness
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Edge Function response caching where appropriate
- Bundle size optimization with tree shaking
- Image optimization for avatars and assets
- Connection pooling for database operations
- CDN integration for static assets

Monitoring:
- Performance metrics collection
- Latency monitoring for auth operations
- Error rate tracking
- User experience metrics
- Database performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Performance benchmarking against 150ms P95 target, load testing with concurrent users, cache effectiveness tests, bundle size analysis, database query performance tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Client-Side Caching and Optimistic Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add client-side caching for team data and user profiles, and implement optimistic updates for UI responsiveness.
### Details:
Use React Query or SWR for data fetching with built-in caching. Configure cache TTL based on data volatility (team data: 5 minutes, user profiles: 15 minutes). Implement optimistic UI updates for common actions like team membership changes, status updates, and profile edits. Store cached data in localStorage with version control for cache invalidation.

## 2. Optimize Database Queries and Connection Pooling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve database performance through query optimization, proper indexing, and connection pooling.
### Details:
Analyze slow queries using database profiling tools. Add appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields (user_id, team_id, timestamps). Implement database connection pooling with a minimum of 5 and maximum of 20 connections. Use prepared statements to reduce query parsing overhead. Consider denormalizing critical data paths where appropriate. Implement query result caching for read-heavy operations.

## 3. Implement Edge Function Response Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add caching strategies for API responses at the edge to reduce latency and backend load.
### Details:
Configure edge caching for read-only endpoints with appropriate cache-control headers. Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern for frequently accessed data. Use cache tags for efficient invalidation. Set up Vercel Edge Functions or similar service for regional caching. Implement cache warming for critical paths. Create cache invalidation hooks for when underlying data changes.

## 4. Optimize Frontend Assets and Implement Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Reduce bundle size, optimize images, implement lazy loading, and integrate CDN for static assets.
### Details:
Configure code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components using React.lazy() and Suspense. Implement tree shaking to eliminate unused code. Optimize images with next/image or similar tools, including proper sizing, WebP format, and lazy loading. Set up CDN integration for static assets with appropriate cache headers. Implement critical CSS extraction for above-the-fold content.

## 5. Implement Performance Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring for performance metrics, latency, error rates, and user experience.
### Details:
Integrate a monitoring solution like New Relic, Datadog, or custom Prometheus/Grafana stack. Configure Real User Monitoring (RUM) to track actual user experience metrics. Set up custom dashboards for P95 latency tracking across all critical operations. Implement alerting for when latency exceeds 150ms P95 threshold. Add custom instrumentation for auth operations and database queries. Create error tracking with appropriate context capture. Set up synthetic monitoring for critical user flows.

# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control and Permissions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive RBAC system with role hierarchy, permission checks, and secure role transitions
# Details:
RBAC Implementation:
- Role hierarchy: super_admin > owner > admin > member
- Permission matrix for all operations (invite, promote, demote, delete, etc.)
- Secure role transition validation (owner transfer, promotion/demotion rules)
- Frontend permission guards for UI elements
- Backend permission validation in Edge Functions
- Role-based route protection middleware
- Cascading team deletion with owner-only access
- Prevention of self-demotion and orphaned teams
- Integration with JWT claims for real-time permission checks

# Test Strategy:
Permission matrix tests for all role combinations, role transition security tests, UI permission guard tests, backend authorization tests, edge case handling (self-operations, last owner scenarios).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Role Hierarchy and Permission Matrix [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data structures for the RBAC system by defining the role hierarchy and comprehensive permission matrix for all operations.
### Details:
1. Define enum/constants for roles (super_admin, owner, admin, member)
2. Create a hierarchical relationship map between roles
3. Define all system operations (invite, promote, demote, delete, etc.)
4. Build a permission matrix mapping roles to allowed operations
5. Document the role hierarchy and permission rules
6. Create utility functions to check if a role is higher than another

## 2. Implement Backend Permission Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build the server-side validation logic in Edge Functions to enforce permission checks based on the defined role hierarchy and permission matrix.
### Details:
1. Create middleware for extracting user roles from JWT claims
2. Implement permission validation functions using the permission matrix
3. Build role transition validation logic (promotion/demotion rules)
4. Create owner transfer validation with security checks
5. Implement prevention of self-demotion logic
6. Add validation to prevent orphaned teams
7. Create reusable permission check decorators/wrappers for Edge Functions

## 3. Develop Role-Based Route Protection [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create middleware for protecting routes based on user roles and implement cascading team deletion with owner-only access.
### Details:
1. Develop middleware to protect routes based on required role level
2. Implement cascading team deletion logic with owner-only access checks
3. Create helper functions to validate user permissions for specific resources
4. Add logging for permission denials and role changes for audit purposes
5. Implement rate limiting for sensitive role operations
6. Create error handlers for unauthorized access attempts

## 4. Implement Frontend Permission Guards [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create UI permission guards to conditionally render elements and actions based on the user's role and permissions.
### Details:
1. Create a client-side permission utility to check user permissions
2. Implement conditional rendering for UI elements based on permissions
3. Add disabled states for actions not allowed for current role
4. Create higher-order components or hooks for permission-based rendering
5. Implement tooltips explaining why actions are unavailable
6. Add visual indicators of user's current role in the UI

## 5. Integrate JWT Claims for Real-Time Permission Checks [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.4
### Description: Connect the RBAC system with JWT authentication to enable real-time permission checks and role updates.
### Details:
1. Update JWT payload structure to include role and permission data
2. Implement JWT refresh logic to update permissions after role changes
3. Create a permission context provider for the frontend
4. Add real-time permission validation on both client and server
5. Implement secure storage of permission data
6. Add event listeners for role changes to trigger permission updates
7. Create comprehensive documentation for the RBAC implementation

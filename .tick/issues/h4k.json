Remove legacy Playwright tests after migration\n\nAgent-browser advantages over Playwright:\n- AI-powered element selection (no brittle selectors)\n- Natural language test descriptions\n- Automatic adaptation to UI changes\n- Built into Claude Code workflow\n\nTest: All flows verified using /agent-browser skill",

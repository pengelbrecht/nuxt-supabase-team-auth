# Test Cleanup Fix Summary

## Problem
The user factory cleanup was reporting success but not actually deleting test data, causing test pollution and database bloat with `@example.com` users and test teams.

## Root Cause
The `ensure_team_has_owner` database trigger was preventing deletion of team members when it would leave a team without an owner. This affected:

1. **User Factory Cleanup**: Could not delete team members or teams
2. **Team Deletion**: Failed when trying to delete the last owner
3. **Test Isolation**: Previous test data remained and interfered with subsequent tests

## Solution
Created dedicated SQL cleanup functions that temporarily disable the constraint trigger:

### 1. Added Migration `20250624120000_add_test_cleanup_function.sql`
- `cleanup_test_team(uuid)`: Cleans up a specific team by temporarily disabling the owner constraint trigger
- `cleanup_all_test_data()`: Comprehensive cleanup of all test data
- `get_test_user_ids()`: Helper function to identify test users

### 2. Updated Test Infrastructure
- **`test-cleanup.ts`**: New centralized cleanup utilities with trigger bypass
- **`user-factory.ts`**: Updated to use the SQL functions instead of direct table operations

### 3. Cleanup Strategy
```sql
-- Temporarily disable trigger
ALTER TABLE team_members DISABLE TRIGGER ensure_team_has_owner;

-- Delete team members and teams
DELETE FROM team_members WHERE team_id = target_team;
DELETE FROM teams WHERE id = target_team;

-- Re-enable trigger
ALTER TABLE team_members ENABLE TRIGGER ensure_team_has_owner;

-- Delete users via auth admin API (cascades to profiles)
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Complete Cleanup**: All test users and teams are now properly deleted
2. **No Test Pollution**: Each test starts with a clean slate
3. **Silent Operation**: Cleanup works efficiently without verbose logging
4. **Constraint Safety**: Trigger is only disabled temporarily and re-enabled
5. **Fallback Support**: Manual cleanup available if SQL functions fail

## Verification
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ No test data leaks between test runs  
- ✅ User factory cleanup works silently and completely
- ✅ Database constraints remain intact for production use
- ✅ RLS policies continue to work correctly

## Files Modified
- `supabase/migrations/20250624120000_add_test_cleanup_function.sql` (new)
- `tests/helpers/test-cleanup.ts` (new)
- `tests/helpers/user-factory.ts` (updated cleanup method)

The fix ensures test data is properly cleaned up while maintaining database integrity and security constraints for production use.
